# WORK IN PROGRESS: xiaomi-zb2mqtt
![Some Xiaomi sensors](xiaomi.png)

Allows you to use your Xiaomi Zigbee sensors and switches **without** Xiaomi's gateway.

It bridges the events sent from the sensors and switches to MQTT. You can integrate the cheap and nice Zigbee sensors and switches with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using.

The [wiki](https://github.com/Koenkk/xiaomi-zb2mqtt/wiki) provides you all the information needed to get up and running!
