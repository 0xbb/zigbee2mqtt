# zigbee2mqtt
![Some Xiaomi sensors](xiaomi.png)

Allows you to use your Zigbee devices **without** the vendors (Xiaomi/TRADFRI/Hue) bridge/gateway.

It bridges the events sent from the sensors and switches to MQTT. In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using. Integrates especially well with [home-assistant.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

See [Supported devices](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Supported-devices) to check wether your device is supported. If it's not listed there support can be added (fairly) easy. Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues) in this case.

The [wiki](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki) provides you all the information needed to get up and running!
